# hello-world 
I used github for years at Big Switch Networks, but I never really learned it well because I am a technical writer
and the developers did all the heavy lifting in regard to code control 
We never got around to using git hub for managing documentation source, which was a huge problem for me.
I had to do all the version control for the Word and Framemaker source files using the company's FTP servers.
We also used gdrive and I originally had the files copied to dropbox as well. 
How many copies of each file did that mean? Given we updated the entire doc set of about 30 documents every few months,
We had a lot of very simillar copies of the same file and no method for managing them. Were mistakes made? Yes, mistakes were made!
